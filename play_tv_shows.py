A module that'll enables us navigate to our TV Shows' directory.
We can then choose a TV Show to watch in various modes; 
1. Watch in series, episode after episode using the preceding episode's time duration as automatic cue
2. For those shows with multiple seasons, we can choose a season & watch
3. For those with single seasons, we can choose an episode or entire season

NB: Assumption that your library is well arranged & VLC is installed
